# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution,
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Find the agreement [here][XING CLA] and head over to [the
contributors page][contributors] and find a XING employee to contact for further
instructions.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help] for more
information on using pull requests.
